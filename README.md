This is my thesis project. The project is entitled Ontolofy-Based Food Selection Recommendation System for Nutrition in School-Age Children discussed how to provide food to meet daily nutritional requirements for school-aged children aged 7-9 years. This project uses a SWRL-based ontology. With program output using Telegram Bot.

The program requires several user inputs such as name, age, gender, height, weight, and physical activity. After inputting, the program will provide recommendations for breakfast, lunch, dinner and 3 snack options to the user. The food provided includes a carbohydrate menu, a protein menu and a vegetables menu.
